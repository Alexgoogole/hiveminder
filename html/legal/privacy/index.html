<&| /_elements/wrapper, title => "About your privacy" &>
<div id="overview">
<p>We take your privacy and security very seriously.  When you choose
to use Hiveminder to keep track of what needs doing, you're entrusting
us with something important to you.  We're going to do everything
we can to make sure that your information stays safe and private.
The legalese below basically says that we do actually collect your 
personal information, that we'll be very careful with it and that if 
somebody tries to mess with us or you, we can do what we need to to 
stop them and make sure it doesn't happen again.</p>

<p>Our lawyers are somewhat old-school and believe strongly in the
power of dense legalese to protect everybody involved. If anything
on this page makes your spidey-sense tingle, drop us a line at <a
href="mailto:privacy@hiveminder.com">privacy@hiveminder.com</a> and
we'll do whatever we can to improve the situation.

   <p><b>Terms of Use and Privacy Policy</b></p>
   <p>This page states the Terms of Use under which users may access, interact with, and otherwise use Hiveminder&trade; (the "Service") and the Privacy Policy applicable to the Service. As used herein, the words "user," "you" and "your" mean users of the Service and the words "we," "our" and "BPS" mean Best Practical Solutions LLC, the owner and operator of the Service.  <b>Please read this page carefully.</b></p>
   
   <p><b>PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
   <p>We embrace the privacy guidelines as developed by the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and this privacy policy adheres to the principles addressed in those guidelines. To view these guidelines, please visit the web sites of the corresponding organization, <a href="http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/ppguidelines.shtml">http://www.privacyalliance.org/resources/ppguidelines.shtml</a> and <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.htm</a>.</p>
   <p><b>Collection and use of non-personal information</b></p>
   <p>If you visit the Service, we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, phone number or email address) unless you provide it, as described under 'Collection of personal information' below. We do, however, collect non-personally-identifiable (anonymous) information about you, such as the server your computer is logged into or your browser type. Other examples of non-personally-identifiable information include:</p>
   <p>Your IP address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web; many Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address).</p>
   <p>Your "top level" domain (i.e., .com, .net, .edu, etc.).</p>
   <p>Standard information included with every communication sent on the Internet, such as browser type, operating system, browser language, service provider, and local time.</p>
   <p>We collect data from the Web logs of the servers -- the computers that "serve up" Web pages - delivering content on the Service.  This includes information about what you view and, along with information gathered from our other users, we create "aggregate data" reports that we may disclose to third parties.  We may also study aggregate data in order to enhance our existing services or develop new services. We will not disclose any personal information to a third party without your express prior written authorization, as described under 'Collection of personal information' below. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our or terms of use or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.</p>
   <p><b>Use of cookies</b></p>
   <p>We use cookies on the Service.  Cookies are used for record keeping, to track your movements when you visit the Service and to help us determine what type of information to present to you. The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them used at most Web sites. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information about you, and do not damage or alter your system files in any way. The first time you visit the Service, BPS assigns you a unique, anonymous, ID, which is stored in the cookie on your computer.</p>
   <p><b>Collection of personal information</b></p>
   <p>You must register in order to use many features of the Service.  We will, and you expressly authorize us to, use the information you provide for the purposes listed in your Registration, including to:</p>
   <ol type="a">
   <li>provide and administer the Service;</li>
   <li>communicate with you about services, features, products, special offers and unique content available through the Service or other topics related to the Service that we think you might find of interest; and</li>
   <li>communicate with you about other products or services we offer.</li>
   </ol>
   <p>We do not share this information with other users of the Service nor with outside parties. The only information we provide to other users is that which you elect to share with them.  We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>
   <p><b>Who is collecting your information</b></p>
   <p>Your information is being collected solely by us. See the discussion under "With whom your information may be shared" below concerning the circumstances under which certain of your information may be disclosed to third parties.</p>
   <p><b>With whom your information may be shared</b></p>
   <p>We do not sell trade or rent your personal information to others. As discussed above under "Collection and use of non-personal information," we may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related site information to third parties or for other marketing and promotional purposes. In these situations, we would not disclose any information that could be used to personally identify you.</p>
   <p><b>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information </b></p>
   <p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in and editing your information through our Preferences function. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.  To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. You may remove yourself from our database at any time by selecting the Deactivate function or by contacting us and requesting to be removed.</p>
   <p><b>Retention of information</b></p>
   
   <p>Any information we collect may be retained for an indeterminate period of time.</p>
   
   <p><b>Confidentiality and Security</b></p>
   
   <p>We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology security in order to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Only our employees have access to the information we collect, and these employees are made aware of and required to comply with our privacy policy.</p>
   
   <p><b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
   
   <p>The Service may provide links to an external Web site. When you click on such a link, you will leave the Service. The privacy policy of the external website will then be in effect, not our policy. We do not control or make an endorsement of any kind regarding the external site or its privacy policy.  Our policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. We do not control cookies from the other sites that you may link to from the Service.</p>

   <p><b>Effect of Legal Obligations upon this Privacy Policy</b></p>
   
   <p>We may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
   
   <p><b>Effect of Privacy Policy</b></p>
   
   <p>This privacy policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or legal rights in or on behalf of any party. As noted above, we may revise this privacy policy from time to time in our sole discretion.</p>
