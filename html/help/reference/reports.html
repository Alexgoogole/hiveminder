<p>Reports are detailed descriptions of your usage of Hiveminder. Most of them
are pretty graphical charts. Hiveminder breaks up the reports you can see into <b>personal reports</b> and <b>group reports</b>.</p>

<p>Personal reports are available from the <a class="external" href="/reports"><b>Reports</b></a> link at the top of the screen. Group reports
are available from the group's pages or from the <a class="external" href="/reports/groups">Personal Group Report</a></b>.</p>

<h3>Personal Reports</h3>

<dl>
    <dt><a class="external" href="/reports">Overview</a></dt>
    <dd><p>This graph displays new tasks and completed tasks. It's plotted over
    the course of a month (each tick along the bottom is a day). The red
    line represents new tasks and the green line represents completed tasks.
    You can move your mouse along the line to see exactly how many tasks were
    created or completed on a given day.</p><dd>

    <dt><a class="external" href="/reports/statistics">Statistics</a></dt>
    <dd><p>This is a table displaying all sorts of information about your
    tasks:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Number of tasks (owned or requested)</b> - how many tasks you've
        either created, or are responsible for completing</li>
        <li><b>Tasks delegated</b> - how many tasks you've created that are
        owned by someone else</li>
        <li><b>Tasks with definite due dates</b></li>
        <li><b>Tasks completed on time</b> - how many tasks have been completed
        before or on their due date. Note that if a task has no due date, it
        counts toward this</li>
        <li><b>Average time to completion</b> - the average time between task
        creation and task completion</li>
        <li><b>Average time left before due date for tasks completed on
        time</b></li>
        <li><b>Average time left before due date for all completed
        tasks</b></li>
    </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt><a class="external" href="/reports/completed">Completed Tasks</a></dt>
    <dd><p>These graphs show when tasks are completed. There are two graphs
    here: tasks completed by day of the week, and tasks completed by hour of
    the day. This lets you see when you're really getting things done.</p></dd>

    <dt><a class="external" href="/reports/created">New Tasks</a></dt>
    <dd><p>These graphs show when tasks are created. Like Completed Tasks,
    there are two here: day of the week, and hour of the day. A spike at
    midnight may be caused by repeating tasks being created.</p></dd>

    <dt><a class="external" href="/reports/time">Time tracking</a></dt>
    <dd><p>This graph shows how accurately you estimate the time for your tasks.
    Each point represents a completed task that has been time tracked.  The line
    is a trend line which gives a nice quick overview.  The ideal trend line is
    a perfect diagonal from the bottom left corner to the top right of the graph.
    Trend lines steeper than this indicate you tend to underestimate how long a task will take.
    Trend lines shallower indicate you overestimate.
    </p></dd>

    <dt><a class="external" href="/reports/groups">Groups</a></dt>
    <dd><p>This pie chart lets you see which groups your tasks fall into. You
    can also find links to the reports for each group here.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Group Reports</h3>

<p>Group reports are not just for your tasks in a group -- they're for all
the tasks for all members of the group. Group reports will look the same
for all members of a group.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Overview</dt>
    <dd><p>This is the same as the Personal Overview, except it's for
    all the tasks in the group, not just yours.</p></dd>

    <dt>Statistics</dt>
    <dd><p>This is the same as Personal Statistics, except for all the tasks
    in the group.</p></dd>

    <dt>Completed Tasks</dt>
    <dd><p>These three graphs display when tasks are completed.</p>
    <p>The first graph is similar to the Personal Overview: it's a display of
    how many tasks were completed each day in the past month. However, it's
    broken up by group member. Each line is a different color, representing one
    member. You can move your mouse over each line to see how many tasks were
    completed on a given day.</p>
    <p>The other two graphs are again identical to Personal Completed Tasks,
    except for all the tasks in the group.</p></dd>

    <dt>New Tasks</dt>
    <dd><p>These two graphs display when tasks are created. These are identical
    to Personal Created Tasks, except for all tasks in the group.</p></dd>

    <dt>Owners</dt>
    <dd><p>These three pie charts display who owns tasks in a group. The first
    is who owns how many incomplete tasks. The second is who owns how many
    complete tasks. The final is who owns how many tasks period (so, a
    combination of the previous two).</p></dd>
    
    <dt>Time tracking</dt>
    <dd><p>This graph shows how accurately the members of your group estimate
    the time for their tasks.  Each point for a person represents a completed task
    that has been time tracked.  The line for each person is a trend line which
    gives a nice quick overview.  The ideal trend line is a perfect diagonal from
    the bottom left corner to the top right of the graph.  Trend lines steeper than
    this indicate the person tends to underestimate how long a task will take.
    Trend lines shallower indicate the person overestimates.
