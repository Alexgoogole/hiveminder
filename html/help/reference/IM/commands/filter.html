%# terse: filter FILTER. Temporarily ignore some tasks. e.g. "filter tag @work". http://tinyurl.com/26pqyv

<p>Filters let you ignore temporarily tasks you don't care about. They help you <b>focus</b> on the tasks that need doing.</p>

<p>You can set filters for anything you can search for. Tags, group, due date, priority, task summary, and so on.</p>

<p>Many filters will affect the tasks you create. For example, if you filter for a particular group, then any tasks created will be put into that group.</p>

<p>You can see your current filters with <b>filter</b>.</p>

<p>You can clear all your filters with <b>filter clear</b>. You can clear individual filters with <b>filter clear <i>filter number</i></b>. The filter number can be negative, meaning "count from the end."

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>filter tag @work <i>- good to do when you get to work</i></li>
    <li>filter not tag @work <i>- good to do when you get out of work</i></li>
    <li>filter query Steve <i> - (searches for Steve in tags, summaries, notes, etc)</i></li>
    <li>filter due before saturday</li>
    <li>filter group Initech Corporation</li>
    <li>filter priority above low</li>
    <li>filter clear</li>
    <li>filter clear 3</li>
    <li>filter clear -1 <i>- clear the most recently added filter</i></li>
    <li>filter clear last <i>- clear the most recently added filter</i></li>
</ul>
