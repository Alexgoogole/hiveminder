%# terse: done TASKS. Use "undone" if you mark the wrong tasks as done. http://tinyurl.com/ypw5fd

<p>Lets you mark tasks as done. Wouldn't be much of a todo list without this one!</p>

<p>You can also use <b>done /<i>search terms</i></b> to save a step in marking multiple tasks as done. If the search returns multiple tasks, then it'll ask for confirmation so you don't accidentally mark unrelated tasks as done. Just say <b>y</b> to mark all the tasks as finished; anything else is interpreted as a fresh command.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/IM/context.html">help context</a> if you're wondering how the last example works!</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>done #631 #689</li>
    <li>finish /lettuce</li>
    <li>done this</li>
</ul>
