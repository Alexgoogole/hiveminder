<&| /help/_elements/prowrapper, title => 'Braindump mailboxes' &>

<p>Braindump mailboxes are the same as your incoming email addresses.
They only ever contain one message, which tells you the email address
for that incoming address.  Dragging existing tasks into a braindump
mailbox makes any changes that the title implies.</p>

<p>You can also copy messages from other email accounts into braindump
mailboxes, which is equivalent to forwarding the message to the
incoming email address.  <b>Beware</b>: click-and-drag in most mail
clients is <i>move</i>, which means that the mail message will be
removed from your other email account.  This may not be what you
want!</p>
