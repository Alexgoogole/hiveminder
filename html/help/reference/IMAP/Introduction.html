<ul>

<li>All of your tasks appear as emails on the server.  Each of these
"emails" includes all of the vital information about a task, including
the complete history of the task.</li>

<li>Because it's too easy to do by mistake, deleting a task using your
email client won't delete the task or mark it as complete -- in fact,
it won't do anything.</li>

<li>To mark a message as done, drag it into the "Completed" mailbox
under "Actions".</li>

<li>Drag messages between folders to change or refile them.  For
instance, to mark a task as a group task, simply drag it into the
group's folder on the server.</li>

<li>You can also use your mail client's "offline" support, if it has
any, to accomplish simple changes to tasks while you're on the
go.</li>

</ul>
