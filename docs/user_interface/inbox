your inbox lets you process "stuff" one item at a time. You can't skip items.

(can you go back?)


you only get a few options. these don't quite hang together for me yet.
I don't know how to differentiate between tasks, projects, next actions. I should reread GTD.


    * Delete it (I don't care about it)
    * Not actionable -  Archive it (finished)  

    * Finished it.

    * Delegate it to EMAIL with MESSAGE  (Here, you deal)
    * Ignore this until  (LALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU)
            Tomorrow
            Next week
            Next month

    * Add a next action

    * Tag this with required capabilities


    If it's an email item
        * Reply to it
