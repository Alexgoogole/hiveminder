        <b class="feature">Search</b>
        Get specific and find only the tasks you need.  Our robust search scheme
        allows you to refine your list to only tasks you want to see.  You can search by using
        the people involved, by any of the relevant dates, by tags, by priority, or
        even by the notes attached to the tasks.

        Any group of people you do stuff with can be a Hiveminder group,
        including your workplace, your household, your sports team, people you're 
        throwing a party with, your band, or your book group.

        If you let us, we'll walk you through your list and force
        you to make some decisions about each task, like whether you want to put it off
        or assign it to someone else.

        <b class="feature">Tasks by email</b>
        Email a task to Hiveminder for yourself or for someone else.
        You can delegate without even logging in, and the person you're delegating to doesn't
        ever have to join Hiveminder!
