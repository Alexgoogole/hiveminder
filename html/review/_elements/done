<p>Nice work.</p>
  <p>You've just looked at every single thing in that list in <%$duration%>.  Now you're a little bit more organized and ready to actually get some stuff done.</p>


<%INIT>
use Time::Duration;
my $started  = Jifty->web->get_variable('started');
my $duration = duration(time - $start, 1);
</%INIT>
<%args>
$start => undef
</%args>
