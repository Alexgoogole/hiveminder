How groups work:
[Things that don't currently work this way are in brackets.]

Amy, Bob, and Carol are users.
Amy creates a Yaks group. She automatically becomes the organizer of that group.

Amy creates task 1 for the Yaks group and assigns it to herself.
Amy finishes task 1. She doesn't get mail about this.

Amy can look at information about the Yaks group. She can invite
people to and remove them from the group.

Amy invites Bob and Carol to the Yaks group. 

Bob gets an invitation email. He accepts the invitation and can now 
see all the tasks in the Yaks group. He can own any task in Yaks or 
take any Yaks task away from any other Yaks member. (Except Amy, the organizer?)

Carol doesn't accept the group invitation. She shouldn't be able to see
anything about the group except the invitation.

Amy asks Bob to do Yaks task 2. Bob gets an email request to do that task. 
He can also see this request in the UI. Bob accepts the task via the web
UI. Bob does the task and marks it done. Amy gets mail about this. The
other members of the Yaks group don't.
