<p>Tags are a really great way to label your tasks.  They're just a list of words you choose to associate with a task.
This makes it easier to find your tasks and to find tasks that are alike or in the same category.  If you 
are trying to file anything, say your DVDs, you instantly run into some issues with how to categorize things.
Does the 1974 TV thriller <i>Killer Bees</i> go under 'K?' Or '1970s?'  Or 'Television Thrillers?'  Maybe it should go under 'Gloria Swanson?'
With tags, you could file it under all of those categories.</p>  
<p>Let's say you have a task called "Take the camera to work for Frank's going-away party."  You could tag
it with [work] because you're going to the office and [home] because that's where the camera is.  You can also
tag it with [camera], [Frank] and [parties].  If you search for any of those tags, or make a list using
them, that task will show up.  Then you'll remember to take the camera to work, and 
you won't miss the opportunity to get pictures of Frank in a paper hat.</p>
<p>In other words, tags will give your tasks context.  You can apply [phone] to all of the
phone calls you need to make.  Likewise, you can imagine how tags like [shopping], [bills],
[car], [kids], ["book club"] etc. might be used.  If you wanted to include [shopping] and [bills]
in a larger [money] category, then you can apply [money] to all of those tasks.  You can then
search for the broader context or the narrower context.  If you have a project, say to build a 
clubhouse, attach [clubhouse] to all of those tasks.  Then you can get increasingly specific for each
part of the larger project - for example:
<ul>
<li>find a tree [clubhouse planning]
<li>create plans [clubhouse planning design]</li> 
<li>create a budget [clubhouse planning money]</li>
<li>buy materials [clubhouse shopping money]</li>
</ul>
You can then find all of those tasks by searching for [clubhouse], the first three by searching
for [clubhouse planning], the last two by searching for [clubhouse money] and so on and so forth.
Use however many tags you need to create as specific a context for your task as you wish.

<p>The tag cloud shows you which tags you're using, and how much you're using them.  It indicates how much you use a tag by making that tag
bigger or smaller, relative to the other tags, so if your "work" tag is bigger than your "fun" tag, 
we would suggest you find more fun things to do.  If you select "all," the tag cloud will reflect the tags of all your 
tasks in Hiveminder.  If you select "page," then the tag cloud will reflect only the tags for the tasks on that page.  Similarly, selecting
"group" will show the tags for everyone's tasks in only that group.</p>
