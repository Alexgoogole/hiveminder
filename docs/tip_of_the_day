Tips:

If one of your task emails gets too spammy, just delete it and generate a new one.

You can get feeds of a certain search that function like a saved list.

Tagging makes finding what you want so much easier, so add as many tags as you want to 
your tasks.

Clicking on a tag in the tagcloud is like a search for that one tag.

Keep your task summaries short, include details in the notes.
