Keep track of what I need to do

Keep track of what I need other people to do.






Today, I want to:

* See what I need to do
* Work through my todo list
* Grab my todo list for offline work

    * Daytime
    * HPDA
    * RSS
    * Printed todo list
* Add some tasks

* See what my teammates need to do
* Assign some tasks

* See what happened yesterday. 



* Groups / teams

    * groups let you set up who can see / edit tasks
    * Groups != projects


* Assignment

    assign tasks to any existing or future user
    
* users / signup

    * email new users when invited to the system / a group
    * email confirmation of addresses

    * we don't spam users per task unless they signup and say "ok"

* Tasks

    * 

* Assignment access control
    * You can invite users to groups that you create
    * You can only assign tasks to users in groups that they've been
      invited to.  
    * Once a user is invited to a group, they can be assigned tasks.
    * If a user rejects a group invitation, they reject all assigned tasks in that group
     



* acls
    * see
    * write 
    * admin


* groups
* tags
* invitations



Use model of 1.0 system.


    jesse signs up at site.
    jesse creates a group.
    jesse invites alex, dave, kevin to join the group.
    dave has an account already, he gets a group confirmation.
    alex has no account. he gets a site invite + a group invite. ideally 1 mail.
    kevin has said he won't use the service before.  he's on a donotcall.
        he gets no mail. 
        jesse gets told kevin won't join.
        this is not 1.0
    jesse starts creating tasks for the group.

    on the group page, he clicks an add tasks button.
    he gets a magic textbox ala jesse's old demo.
    jesse can assign tasks to alex and dave.
    note that alex has no account yet.

    each task generates a mail to the owner?
    owners can update tasks by mail. even without an account.




    jesse assigns a new task to dave:

        fix quebec redirect bug by tuesday.

    site sends mail to dave with content.
    dave can reply by mail with html mail buttons
    dave can reply by replying to email
   
    dave sees a few things on his homepage.
