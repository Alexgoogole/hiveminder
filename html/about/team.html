  <p>
  Jesse Vincent is the President and Founder of Best Practical.
  He's responsible for...just about everything around
  here.  Jesse lives the Internet-Rockstar lifestyle and can most
  often be found writing code in trendy WiFi-equipped cafes across
  the US, Europe and Asia.  When he's not busy hacking on Hiveminder,
  <a href="http://jifty.org/" target="_blank">Jifty</a> or <a
  href="http://bestpractical.com/rt/" target="_blank">RT</a>, Jesse
  spends his time dreaming up crazy schemes designed to bankrupt
  Best Practical and drive everyone who works here insane.

       alt="Chia-liang Kao's mugshot" />
  <p>
  Chia-liang (CL) is a partner in Best Practical and is the creator
  of SVK, the version control system that made developing Hiveminder
  so easy.  He had the good fortune to be able to spend a year
  wandering mountain ranges and exploring natural hotsprings while
  developing SVK.  While he currently lives in London, he is
  ever-vigilant in his quest for new hotsprings to enjoy.  Previously,
  he lived on and worked from a hidden fortress/tea
  plantation in the mountains of Taiwan, the tea from which
  powered the development of Hiveminder.

  <h3>Alex Vandiver <span class="title">Itinerant Coder</span></h3>

       alt="Alex Vandiver's mugshot" />
  <p>
Alex is a recent graduate of MIT, where he majored in computer
science.  Before too long, he will head back to those verdant
pastures for his master's degree, and we will miss him.  He is known
in some circles as the "duck-billed cat-a-moose" due to his proclivity
for animal noises.  Fond of both swords and software, Alex has yet
to find a way to combine these passions in a productive way.

  <p>
Cassandra takes care of things here. She makes sure that Jesse's where
he needs to be, that we mostly remember to eat lunch, and (perhaps
most importantly) that everybody gets paid. When Cassandra isn't busy
answering your hiveminder questions she writes, cooks, and gardens.

       height="100"
       alt="Thomas Sibley's mugshot" />
  <p>
Tom is responsible for how very, very pretty Hiveminder is.  Although
he calls southeast Pennsylvania home, Tom is a student at Amherst
College, where he is a member of the class of 2010.  He is considering
bending his considerable aesthetic sensibilities to a career in
photography once he graduates.  In his spare time, he hugs trees,
and - let's face it - they need the attention.

  <h3>Kevin Riggle <span class="title">Minion</span></h3>
  <img src="/static/images/bees/kevin.png"
       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="Kevin Riggle's mugshot" />
  <p>
  Kevin Riggle is a member of the class of 2008 at MIT, where he
  majors in electrical engineering and computer science.  He is the
  President and Skinner of the MIT Science Fiction Society and
  recently wrote a 19-page paper detailing the the relationship of
  the television show <i>Firefly</i> to film westerns.  His hair is 
  (usually, mostly) blue.

       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="Keri Shaughnessy's mugshot" />
  <p>
  Keri is responsible for Sales and Marketing at Best Practical.
She's an organization fanatic --  she makes to do lists about her
to do lists (using Hiveminder, of course), rabidly organizes her
massive music collection, and obsesses over iCal and her Treo.  When
not organizing or marketing, she gets all hopped up on coffee and/or
Red Bull and drives around.

  <h3>Nelson Elhage <span class="title">Nap Hacker</span></h3>
  <img src="/static/images/bees/nelson.png"
       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="Nelson Elhage's mugshot" />
  <p>
   Although deadly accurate with a bow and arrow, Nelson has never
   killed anyone.  He is a member of MIT's class of 2009, where he
   is majoring in computer science and maybe physics.  He is
   theoretically literate in both Latin and Ancient Greek, and has
   green hair.  While working on Hiveminder, we forced
   Nelson to spend far too much time monkeying around with the deep,
   dark corners of a number of web browsers.

  <h3>Shane Landrum <span class="title">Cat Herder Supreme</span></h3>
  <img src="/static/images/bees/shane.png"
       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="Shane Landrum's mugshot" />
  <p>
  Shane graduated from Smith College in 1998 and subsequently wrote
  software at various dotcoms and web-consulting shops. He has been
  writing code and project-managing for Hiveminder while also
  studying for a Ph.D. in American History at Brandeis University.
  In his free time, Shane turns his attention to cooking, grassroots
  political organizing, and cycling.

  <h3>Zev Benjamin <span class="title">Legionnaire</span></h3>
  <img src="/static/images/bees/zev.png"
       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="Zev Benjamin's mugshot" />
  <p>
     Zev's been responsible for making sure that Hiveminder (and
     every other Best Practical product) works right.  This summer,
     he's applied his skills as a computer science major at MIT
     (class of 2008) to create a continuous-testing system called
     "Chimps" (The Collaborative Heterogeneous Infinite Monkey
     Perfectionification Service) and to maintain a feisty IRC bot
     designed to harass us all into fixing our code.  He has been
     known to sport flowing, emerald locks, and to travel widely
     to such exotic locations as Spain, Italy, Britain, Israel,
     Turkey, Peru, and his native Dresher, PA.

  <h3>Jason Haas <span class="title">Wordifier</span></h3>
  <img src="/static/images/bees/jason.png"
       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="Jason Haas' mugshot" />
  <p>
  Jason can hardly code at all, but he's pretty good with English
  so he wrote many of the words that appear in Hiveminder.  He
  graduated with a degree in film studies from Wesleyan University,
  and recently completed a master's in education at Harvard University.
  Jason gets to blend his passions for film and improv comedy as
  the director of the Boston chapter of <i>Neutrino Video Projects</i>.

  <h3>David Glasser <span class="title">Developer Emeritus</span></h3>

       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="David Glasser's mugshot" />
  <p>
  Dave built much of the first version of Hiveminder, as well as
  large parts of <a href="http://jifty.org/" target="_blank">Jifty</a>.
  He holds a BS from MIT in Computer Science and Mathematics, and is
  currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science.  He had
  green hair long before Nelson did, and makes a damned fine peanut
  soup.

  <h3>Shawn Moore <span class="title">Bot Wrangler</span></h3>
  <img src="/static/images/bees/shawn.png"
       width="100"
       height="100"
       alt="Shawn Moore's mugshot" />
  <p>
  Shawn is responsible for the IM bots and some of the odds-and-ends of
  Hiveminder. While not a college graduate, he certainly got an unusual
  education in mastering the nuances of NetHack. His passion these days
  include learning and teaching Go, reading science fiction, and (naturally)
  hacking away at Perl.</p>
