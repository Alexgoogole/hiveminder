So, here's a brain dump of what's left for the time tracking branch.

- Reports
   - Take a collection of tasks ("any tasklist/project/deadline")
     and report:
       - total estimated time
       - total time worked
       - total time left (based on original estimates - worked)
       - total estimated time left (based on estimates of time left)
       - time over/under estimate(s)
       - average estimated time per task
       - possibly graphs like time worked over time, or estimate changes
         these would require going through task transactions/histories

     This is probably accomplished with a custom Report subclass that
     takes tokens or a collection and runs a couple SQL statements.

     All of this would ideally also be limited to a time period, which
     will require going through task transactions/histories to find
     changes to time tracking fields.  (And be more complex, obviously.)

   - User help for all of this

- Possibly rethink the UI for setting / updating times
   (although it works pretty well now)


Right now, time tracking is a pro feature.  Some of the ACLs would 
require some redoing if we wanted to make it something able to be turned 
on for specific groups regardless of pro status.

It could probably always use some kicking of the tires of course before 
a mergedown.
