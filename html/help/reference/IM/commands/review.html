%# terse: review. Goes over each of your tasks so you can take action. http://tinyurl.com/25b6ob

<p>Shows you tasks one by one and asks for some kind of decision on each one.</p>

<p><b>review</b> alone will ask you about each task that's on your todo list. <b>review these</b> will review the tasks in your current context (see <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/IM/context.html">help context</a>). <b>review all</b> will look for the last list that was shown to you (from <b>todo</b> or <b>search</b>) and review each task from it (not just tasks on the current page).</p>

<p>When you're reviewing tasks, there are a number of shortcuts. They're displayed on the review menu itself. Also, you can type in just a number and that will be interpreted as "hide this until X days from now". So 1 would mean "hide until tomorrow", 365 would mean "hide until next year".</p>

<p>Other than the shortcuts, you can use just about every command, like <b>priority</b> and <b>comment</b>.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>review</li>
    <li>review /work</li>
    <li>review these</li>
    <ul>
        <li>todo work</li>
        <li>review all</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
