<p>Using the instant messaging system, you can perform all of the common
Hiveminder operations. You can quickly create new tasks and update existing
tasks (mark them as done, set their due date and priority, give them to other
people, and so on). It's much quicker than loading up your browser, so you're
more likely to actually keep track of even the little tasks.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you need to link an IM account to your Hiveminder account.
It's easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/prefs/IM',
                                 label  => 'Tasks by IM',
                                 class  => 'external' ) %>
      under <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/prefs',
                                 label  => 'Preferences',
                                 class  => 'external' ) %>.
  </li>
  <li>Click the "Give me a password!" button.</li>  
  <li>Send an IM to <b>HM Tasks</b> (or, if you're on Jabber or Google Chat,
      <b>HMTasks@hiveminder.com</b>) with the password we just gave
      you. (Not your account's password!)</li>
</ol>

<p>After that, any command HM Tasks receives from that screenname will affect your account. Here's a sample session. See
  <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/help/reference/IM',
                       label  => 'the IM help' ) %>
for more specific help.
