%# terse: todo. Shows you your regular task list. http://tinyurl.com/2xhnnq

<p>Shows you tasks you own that you haven't finished yet. This is the same list as <a href="http://hiveminder.com/todo">your Hiveminder home page</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use <b>todo <i>search terms</i></b> to narrow down your todo list; this is useful if you're looking for a specific task or set of tasks to do.</p>

<p>It currently only supports your own tasks, not those of any of your groups.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>todo</li>
    <li>todo meetup</li>
    <li>t dinner</li>
</ul>
