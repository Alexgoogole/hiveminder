%# terse: delete TASKS. Watch out, you'll never see them again! http://tinyurl.com/ys63lw

<p>Lets you delete tasks. Use done if you finish a task, use this if you accidentally created a task you don't want.</p>

<p>You can also use <b>delete /<i>search terms</i></b> to save a step in deleting multiple tasks. If the search returns multiple tasks, then it'll ask for confirmation so you don't accidentally delete unrelated tasks. Just say <b>y</b> to delete all the tasks; anything else is interpreted as a fresh command.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/IM/context.html">help context</a> if you're wondering how the last example works!</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>delete #IK #CH #DF</li>
    <li>delete /hello world</li>
    <li>delete this</li>
</ul>
