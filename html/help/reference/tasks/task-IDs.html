<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'Task IDs' &>

<p>When you're trying to talk about tasks with other people, it can be hard to be clear which task you're talking about.
  To help make things clearer, we created 'Task IDs' like the ones used in airline ticketing, composed of numbers and letters (i.e.
"5H4") to make it easier to get specific.  These identifiers are unique across all of Hiveminder, so no two tasks in our entire system will have 
the same Task ID.  They may take a little getting used to, but you'll thank us later.</p>
