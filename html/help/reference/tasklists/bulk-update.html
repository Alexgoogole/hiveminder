<p>Bulk Update allows you to update several tasks at the same time. Use the
"Search" function to narrow down the list down to the tasks you want to update,
and then use the "Not this" links to remove tasks you weren't able to sort out
of your list using "Search." You can now change the due date, the tags, the
priority or any other task detail on all of those tasks all at once.</p>

%# we already have help on how to rename a tag. maybe this should change.

<p>You can use Bulk Update to, for example, change the tag "money" to "spending":</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to your <% Jifty->web->link(url => '/todo', label => 'todo list') %>.</li>
    <li>Click the <tt>money</tt> tag in your tag cloud.</li>
    <li>Click <tt>Bulk Update</tt> at the top of the task list.</li>
    <li>Click <tt>All</tt> at the top right to show all tasks instead of just the current page.</li>
    <li>Put "spending" into <tt>Add Tags</tt> in the Bulk Update window.</li>
    <li>Put "money" into <tt>Remove Tags</tt> in the Bulk Update window.</li>
    <li>Click <tt>Save Changes</tt>.</li>
</ol>
