%# terse: TASK1 then TASK2. Sets up a task dependency. http://tinyurl.com/2d4b3q

<p>Lets you set up a task dependency, such that one task hides until is another is done.</p>

<p>Right now it's very limited in that it only lets you type in exactly two task IDs (and you can't even search). We're still working out what it should do in more complicated cases.</p>

<p>You can also type in "task then task" and it should just work (unless of course that first task ID happens to be a valid command).</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>then #IAK #FAL</li>
    <li>#IAK then #FAL</li>
    <li>IAK then FAL</li>
</ul>
