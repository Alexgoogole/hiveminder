<p>Tasks can sometimes have files associated with them. For example, a "make birthday card for mom" task might make use of photographs.</p>

<p>Hiveminder Pro users can <em>attach</em> files to tasks, much like you do with email. There are a few ways you can add attachments to a task:</p>

<ul>
    <li>On a task's edit page, click the Attachments tab in the top menu. There you can upload, view, edit, and delete any attachments.</li>
    <li>When you <a href="/help/how-to/create-tasks-by-email.html">create tasks by email</a>, any attachments in the email will be automatically added to created tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each attachment must be less than
  <% BTDT->english_filesize(Jifty->config->app('MaxAttachmentSize'), 0) %>
  and each user is limited to a total of
  <% BTDT->english_filesize(Jifty->find_plugin('Jifty::Plugin::Quota')->default_cap('disk', 'User'), 0) %> for attachments across all tasks.  Pro users can check their quota usage on their
  <% Jifty->web->link( url => '/account', label => 'account page', class => 'external' ) %>.
</p>

<p>Note that anyone who can see a task is able to see its attachments. Anyone who can edit a task is able to edit its attachments.</p>
