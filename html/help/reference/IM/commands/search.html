<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'IM Command: Search' &>

%# terse: search QUERY. Lets you search *all* of your tasks, not just the ones on your todo list. http://tinyurl.com/yucjr2

<p>Basically the same as the <b>todo</b> command but less restrictive. Todo won't show you finished tasks, or tasks that people have assigned to you but that you haven't accepted.</p>

<p>The search command only works for task summaries, tags, etc, similarly to the search box in Hiveminder's web interface. If you want to search for more complicated criteria such as priority or due date, see <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/IM/commands/filter">help filter</a>.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>search birthday</li>
    <li>find archery</li>
    <li>/weekend</li>
</ul>
