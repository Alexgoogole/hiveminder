%# terse: invite EMAIL. Tell somebody about how great Hiveminder is! http://tinyurl.com/56sn22

<p>The invite command lets you invite people to Hiveminder.</p>

<p>We just need their email address. We'll send them an email explaining what Hiveminder is and how to sign up for it.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>invite my.best.friend@example.com</li>
</ul>
