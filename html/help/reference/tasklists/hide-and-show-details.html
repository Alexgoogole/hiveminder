While we are proud of the amount of information that we allow you to attach to your tasks, we 
want you to be able to look at a very simple list in the case that you get overwhelmed.
 Clicking "Hide Details" shows you your list with only the task summaries visible.  Clicking 
 "Show Details" will bring all of your glorious details right back to you.
