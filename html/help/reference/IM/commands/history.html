%# terse: history TASK. Shows the complete history of the task. http://tinyurl.com/244wsl

<p>Shows you the history of a given task, such as when tags were changed, and when it was created.</p>

<p>History display is limited to only one task at a time.</p>

<p>You can also use <b>history /<i>search terms</i></b> to save a step in getting the history of a task. If the search returns multiple tasks, then it'll show you the history of just the first.</p>

<p>Because history only shows you one task, saying just <b>history</b> alone will show you the first task in your context. See also <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/IM/context.html">help context</a>.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>history #8AT</li>
    <li>history /candy</li>
    <li>history this</li>
    <li>history</li>
</ul>
