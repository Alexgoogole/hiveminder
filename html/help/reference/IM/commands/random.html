%# terse: random. Gives you a random task. http://tinyurl.com/2ax9v7

<p>Gives you a random task. Very handy if you have a lot of little things that need doing, but you're not sure where to start. This gives you only tasks that would show up in your todo list (meaning incomplete tasks that aren't hidden, and so on).</p>

<p>You can also use <b>random <i>search terms</i></b> to narrow down the pickins.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>random</li>
    <li>random book</li>
</ul>
