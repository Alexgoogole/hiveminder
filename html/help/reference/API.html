<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'API' &>

<p>
    Hiveminder has a simple, yet powerful API. Like the rest of our
    application, we try to give you the building blocks to use Hiveminder
    however suits you best.
</p>

<p>
    You can see the very terse description of the API at
    <a href="/=/help">http://hiveminder.com/=/help</a>. This document is more
    of a walkthrough to how it all works, and how you can use it.
</p>

<p>
    We also have a
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hiveminder-api">mailing list</a>
    for discussing Hiveminder's API and what people are doing with it. Join us!
</p>

<p>
    If you speak Perl, we have a ready-made <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Hiveminder/lib/Net/Hiveminder.pm">Net::Hiveminder</a> to ease working with
    our API.
</p>

<p>
    Our API assumes that you're logged in (or using <a href="/oauth">OAuth</a>)
    Logged in users have a cookie, <tt>JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER</tt>. You'll need
    to send this cookie with every request, so we know who you are.
</p>

<p>
    To play around, we'll use the <tt>curl</tt> command line utility. It makes
    this kind of interaction easy. You'll also need your
    <tt>JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER</tt> cookie. In further commands, we'll be
    calling it <tt><i>$COOKIE</i></tt>.
</p>

<p>
    You can quickly get a cookie by running the following command. Be sure to
    put in your email address and password.
</p>

<p>
    <tt>curl -is -F 'J:A-login=BTDT::Action::Login' -F 'J:A:F-address-login=EMAILADDRESS' -F 'J:A:F-password-login=PASSWORD' http://hiveminder.com/splash | grep -o 'JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=[0-9a-f]\+'</tt>
</p>

<h2>Creating a Task</h2>

<h3>The Request</h3>

<pre>curl -b JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=<i>$COOKIE</i> -F summary="hello from curl" http://hiveminder.com/=/model/Task.yml</pre>

<p>There are a few pieces to this. Here's what each one means:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><tt>curl</tt></dt>
    <dd>The name of the program</dd>

    <dt><tt>-b JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=<i>$COOKIE</i></tt></dt>
    <dd>How you tell <tt>curl</tt> what your cookie is, for authentication</dd>

    <dt><tt>-F summary="hello from curl"</tt></dt>
    <dd>How you tell <tt>curl</tt> the arguments to this task creation</dd>

    <dt><tt>http://hiveminder.com/=/model/Task.yml</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        The URL of the request. The <tt>.yml</tt> indicates we want our result
        in YAML, we could also pick <tt>.xml</tt>, <tt>.json</tt>, and even
        <tt>.pl</tt>.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>The Response</h3>

<p>
    If all goes well, you'll get the following response (in YAML just as we
    requested):
</p>

<pre>
---
action_class: BTDT::Action::CreateTask
content:
    id: 271901
    record_locator: ACJX
error: ~
failure: 0
field_errors: {}
field_warnings: {}
message: Your task has been created!
success: 1
</pre>

<p>Let's examine some of these fields:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><tt>action_class: BTDT::Action::CreateTask</tt></dt>
    <dd>The action that the server ran. You can ignore this one.</dd>

    <dt><tt>id: 271901</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        The numeric ID of the created task.
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>record_locator: ACJX</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        The human-friendly version of the task ID. This is what we display
        as the task ID in the web interface and elsewhere. This is
        because #ACJX is a lot easier to remember. We use the
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Number-RecordLocator/"
        >Number::RecordLocator Perl module</a> to convert between the
        actual numeric ID and the friendlier record locator.
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>error: ~</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        In YAML, a tilde represents no value. So there were no errors.
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>field_errors: {}</tt> and <tt>field_warnings: {}</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        These are (empty) mappings of column name to validation and
        canonicalization notices. For example, if you give a due date of
        "tomorrow" then field_warnings will be <tt>due: <%
            BTDT::DateTime->now->add(days => 1)->ymd %></tt> to tell you that
        it canonicalized the value you gave it. You can ignore these.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    In addition to getting a response, we also get some special values in the
    HTTP response header. Namely, Hiveminder gives response code 302 to
    indicate redirection. We also get <tt>Location:
    http://hiveminder.com/=/model/BTDT%3A%3AModel%3A%3ATask/id/271901</tt>
    (the redirection's target URL) to tell you how to read the newly created
    object. So if you're using a library in your favorite programming language,
    you may instead see the task itself, instead of the create action's results.
</p>

<h2>Generic CRUD</h2>

<p>
    Hiveminder's API lets you <b>c</b>reate, <b>r</b>ead, <b>u</b>pdate, and
    <b>d</b>elete things (as long as you have permission to do it). It's not
    limited to just tasks either; you can create groups, delete IM
    accounts, and so on. Using our API, you can do everything that our
    other interfaces do, and more.
</p>

<p>
    We make use of different HTTP request methods. You're probably familiar with
    <tt>GET</tt> and <tt>POST</tt>. We use <tt>GET</tt> for reading objects and
    <tt>POST</tt> for creating them. We also use <tt>PUT</tt> for update and
    <tt>DELETE</tt> for delete. Here are examples of using curl for each of
    these.
</p>

<p>Create a new task: <tt>curl -F summary=hello -b JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=<i>$COOKIE</i> http://hiveminder.com/=/model/Task.yml</tt></p>

<p>Read task 271901: <tt>curl -b JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=<i>$COOKIE</i> http://hiveminder.com/=/model/Task/id/271901.yml</tt></p>

<p>Update task 271901's due date: <tt>curl -X PUT -F due=tomorrow -b JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=<i>$COOKIE</i> http://hiveminder.com/=/model/Task/id/271901.yml</tt></p>

<p>Delete task 271901: <tt>curl -X DELETE -b JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=<i>$COOKIE</i> http://hiveminder.com/=/model/Task/id/271901.yml</tt></p>

<h2>Actions</h2>

<p>
    In addition to CRUD, we also expose our actions. Actions are like
    functions: each takes arguments, does its thing, then returns values. We
    have a wide range of actions, from CRUD, to braindump, even upgrading to
    Pro.
</p>

<p>
    Let's have a look at our braindump action, ParseTasksMagically. It takes
    two arguments. The first, "text", you're already familiar with: it's the
    text you submit that eventually becomes tasks.
</p>

<p>
    The second argument is "tokens", which we don't expose in the web
    interface. Every tasklist has a list of tokens associated with it, things
    like "due before today", "owner me", and "tag music". This token list is
    the tasklist's identity; when you export tasks to a text file, or get an
    Atom feed of the tasklist, tokens are what is saved. Anyway, you can pass
    in tokens to this argument to set attributes for <em>all</em> of the
    created tasks at once.
</p>

<p>
    Let's say we want to braindump the following text:
</p>

<pre>
finish documenting API [hiveminder]
    just need to think of a good example braindump
profit!
</pre>

<p>
    We also want to apply the following tokens to these tasks, namely
    "tag @work". So after URI-encoding everything, we end up with this (lines
    broken for clarity):
</p>

<pre>
curl

-F text='finish documenting API [hiveminder]
    just need to think of a good example braindump
profit!'

-F tokens='tag @work'

-b JIFTY_SID_HIVEMINDER=<i>$COOKIE</i>

http://hiveminder.com/=/action/ParseTasksMagically.yml
</pre>

<p>
    You'll get back a lot of text. Among other things, you'll see fields called
    "completed", "create_failed", "update_failed", and "updated".  These are
    there because ParseTasksMagically is actually a specialization of
    UploadTasks, so you can ignore these fields. It's hopefully mostly obvious
    what the rest of it means.
</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>We have a number of ways to let you search through your tasks:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><tt>/=/action/BTDT.Action.TaskSearch</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        Token-based search for tasks. Practically every time you have a
        tasklist in the web interface, you're using this action.
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>/=/action/BTDT.Action.DispatchQuicksearch</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        A text-based search that looks through your tasks' summaries,
        descriptions, and tags
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>/=/action/BTDT.Action.SearchTask</tt></dt>
    <dd>A generic action for searching for basic column values</dd>

    <dt><tt>/=/model/BTDT.Model.Task/column</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        List all the values of <i>column</i> for tasks you can see
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>/=/model/BTDT.Model.Task/column/value</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        A "search" for one column-value pair. You'll only get one result, so
        it's recommended you use this when you know your column is unique.
    </dd>

    <dt><tt>/=/search/BTDT.Model.Task/column1/value1/column2/value2</tt></dt>
    <dd>
        A search for column-value pairs. Can return multiple values.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Except for the first two, these are available for all models, not just
Tasks.
</p>

<h2>Discoverability</h2>

<p>
    We've tried to make our API <i>discoverable</i>. If you want to know what
    arguments an action takes, or what columns a model has, you can easily
    figure that out.
</p>

<p>
    If you want to know what arguments the UploadTasks action takes, you can
    get that information with:
</p>

<pre>
curl http://hiveminder.com/=/action/UploadTasks.yml
</pre>

<p>
    If you want to know what columns a Task has:
</p>

<pre>
curl http://hiveminder.com/=/model/Task.yml
</pre>
