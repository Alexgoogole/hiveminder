<p>
Marking a task as "hide forever" will make it never show up in most normal task
lists.  You are still able to search for your "hidden forever" tasks and can
unhide them again if you want.

<p>
We tend to use this concept to indicate whether a task will ever be completed
or not.  Sometimes it is useful to keep a task around in your history,
but indicate that you never want to see it again and will never complete it.
