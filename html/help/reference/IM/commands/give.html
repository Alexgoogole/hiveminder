%# terse: give TASKS to PERSON. Assign tasks to other people. http://tinyurl.com/yw8pj6

<p>Lets you assign tasks to other people. Just use their email address. They don't even need to be signed up for Hiveminder!</p>

<p>If you use "give up" or "give away", you can abandon tasks (this is really only useful in a group context, where it means "I don't want to do this, someone else in the group can do it, I don't care who"). You can also give directly to the special user "nobody" to abandon tasks.</p>

<p>See also <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/IM/context.html">help context</a> if you're wondering how the last example works!</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>give #W to john@example.com</li>
    <li>give 6NCE 6NCF subordinate@work.com</li>
    <li>give up #7777</li>
    <li>give 7777 to nobody</li>
    <li>give these devteam@nethack.org</li>
</ul>
