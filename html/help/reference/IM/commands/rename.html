%# terse: rename TASK to NEWNAME. Changes the summary of a task. http://tinyurl.com/ytcpj5

<p>Lets you change the summary of a task.</p>

<p>You can only change the summary of a single task at a time. It wouldn't be very helpful to have two different tasks named "Buy a new car"</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>rename #27B6 to Attend bear seminar</li>
    <li>rename 3142 to You can even use braindump syntax [cool] [priority high]</li>
    <li>rename 1414 to [don't-do-this-though your-task-will-have-no-summary]</li>
    <li>rename /banana to this only works if "banana" only has one hit</li>
</ul>
