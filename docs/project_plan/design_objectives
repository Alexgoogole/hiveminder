Interface:

 * Should provide finite-length, readable URLS whenever possible; all
   URLs should be lower-case, descriptive names

 * Should provide basic functionality on downscale, non-JS enabled
   browsers; it is acceptable that some more advanced features not
   work.  It is also acceptible to provide an alternate downlevel view
   for some features.

 * Should make use of one (or more?) centralized CSS style sheets,
   with as much presentation and style information embedded therein as
   possible.

Implementation

 * Should not include inline style and presentation information
 
 * Using Module::Pluggable, Module::Refresh, UNIVERSAL::require, etc is a whole
   lot easier if no modules do anything special for ->import, so don't do anything
   special on ->import.  (ie, the only difference between 'use' and 'require' should
   be when it happens.)
