%# terse: I remember what tasks you're working on so you don't need to repeat yourself. e.g. "c sleep" "priority high". http://tinyurl.com/2wuhrf

<p>Hiveminder's IM system supports the notion of context. Isn't it annoying to have to tell me what tasks you're talking about all the time?</p>

<p>Instead, with the context system, you can use <b>this</b> or <b>these</b> (makes no difference which one you use) in place of task IDs, like so:</p>

<pre>create finish reading Dune [book dune]
due this by thursday
comment this wow what a great book!
tag this [favorite]
done this</pre>

<p>The <b>show</b> command will list the tasks are in your current context.</p>
