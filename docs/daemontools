DaemonTools keeps processes running. Once DaemonTools is chugging along
happily, adding new programs under it isn't too hard.

/service contains a directory for each program you want to keep running. For
example, if you have a service named FOO, then you'd have /service/FOO, and in
that directory you'd have a script named run -- /service/FOO/run

run (and perhaps FOO) needs to be owned by nobody. run should be a symlink to a
script in the BTDT svn repository, so it can be updated. run needs to be +x.

The script will be run as root, will be run from some unknown directory, and
will have no environment. So you need to drop priviledges, cd into the BTDT
directory, and set the env variables you care about (in particular, HOME,
PATH, and PERL5LIB).

See bin/im-run for an example.

According to djb, svscan looks for new things in /service every five seconds,
so that should be all. You may need to kick some things over if not.


If any DaemonTools-managed program breaks and doesn't come back up, check the
executable bits and permissions on the bin/ scripts that are symlinked from
/service. Subversion seems to misstep here a lot.
