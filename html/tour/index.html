    If you're like us, you forget half of the things you're 
    supposed to be doing because you spend time trying <em>really hard</em> to remember 
    the other half.  Hiveminder lets you take your mind off getting things done so that 
    you actually just do them.  Let us show you around!
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is a To Do List - where all of the tasks in your Hiveminder account
    hang out.  It's kind of like your email "inbox."  Check out some of the features 
    below by mousing over the numbers in the blue circles.
