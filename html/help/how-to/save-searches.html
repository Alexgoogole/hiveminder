<p>To make <a href="/help/reference/how-to/search.html">our powerful search feature</a> even more useful, <a href="/pro" class="external">pro users</a> can now save their searches. Spend less time searching, more time doing!</p>

<p>You can create a saved search in three easy steps.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Do your search. How about "All tasks above normal priority with tag @work"?</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Save List</strong> link above the list of tasks.</li>
    <li>Type in a name for your search. (such as "Urgent, for work")</li>
</ol>

<p>Using saved searches is easy too.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the arrow next to <strong>To Do</strong> in the top menu bar.</li>
    <li>Click the saved search you want to see.</li>
</ol>
