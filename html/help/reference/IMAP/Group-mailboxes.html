<p>Group mailboxes contain all of the tasks for the group, split into
four categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tasks you own (filed under <pre>Groups/groupname</pre>)</li>
<li>Tasks nobody owns (filed under <pre>Groups/groupname/Up for grabs</pre>)</li>
<li>All tasks, no matter who owns them (filed under <pre>Groups/groupname/All tasks</pre>)</li>
<li>Tasks other people own (filed under <pre>Groups/groupname/Everyone else's tasks</pre>)</li>
<ul>

<p>You can drag tasks into any of these except the last; doing so will
make it a group task, as well as being owned by you if you dragged it
into the list of tasks you own.</p>
