<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'Search' &>

<p>One of the things we're very proud of in Hiveminder is that every list is the result of some search
or another.  This makes it very easy to be looking at your tasks due today one minute, and then 
looking at everything due tomorrow the next.  One minute your To Do list is your tasks for your 
household, and the next you're planning for work.</p>

        <ul>
                <li><strong>Sort tasks by</strong>
                     <p>Sorting allows you to determine which order your tasks will appear in in your new list.
                       The default is explained in a page linked above.  The choices in the dropdown menu
                       allow you to sort by:
             </p>
                       <ul>
                        <li><strong>Name</strong> will give you alphabetical order.</li>
                        <li><strong>Priority</strong> will group your tasks from highest to lowest priority.</li>
                        <li><strong>Due</strong> orders tasks by due date from earliest to latest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Completed</strong> groups and orders tasks by complete-ness: incomplete,
                        then complete.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hide until</strong> orders tasks by their 'hide until' date, earliest 
                        to latest.  Tasks with out a "Hide until" will then be ordered in by default.</li>
                        <li><strong>Age</strong> orders tasks by when they were created, from earliest to latest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Owner</strong> orders and groups tasks by who owns them, alphabetically by 
                        name.  Tasks with no owner are always ordered first.</li>
                        <li><strong>Requestor</strong> orders and groups tasks by who created them, alphabetically
                        by name.</li>
                       </ul>
             <p>
                       Sorting by tags will bring the tasks with the tags you specify to the top of list.
                         If you search by multiple tags, it will sort by bringing the tasks with the most of
                       those tags to the top.  Tasks will then be sorted by using the tags you entered in the
                       order you entered them.  The rest of your tasks will be ordered by default.
                     </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Done or Not done</strong>
                     <p>This allows you to determine whether or not you are seeing tasks you have 
                     marked "done" or tasks that are not done.  You can use the checkboxes to see 
                     just the "not done," just the "done" or both (which will be all of the tasks 
                     you are still the owner of in Hiveminder.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Accepted, Declined or Unaccepted</strong>
                     <p>Similar to Done or Not done, this allows you to determine whether your search
                      will include only the tasks you (or others) have accepted, only the tasks which
                      have been turned down, only the tasks which are still being thought about, or any
                      combination of the three.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Will be done, will never be done</strong>
                     <p>Sometimes you want to mark tasks as "will never complete" -- where neither
                     deleting the task, nor marking it as complete are quite the right thing.  This
                     option allows you to find tasks which the owner has decided they will never complete.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>"..." is and isn't "..."</strong>
                     <p>Here you can use any of the variables listed to determine which tasks will show up in 
                     your list.  You can use these fields to get as narrow a list as you might want.  Use 
                     the positive "is" or "includes" fields to input the information you want attached
                     to the tasks you're looking for, and the "isn't" or "lacks" fields to indicate which
                     tasks you definitely <strong>don't</strong> want by the attached information.</p>
                     <p>If you search for multiple tags, it will only provide you with the tasks where those 
                     tags overlap.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Date info</strong>
                     <p>The date information will allow you to search your tasks by the date the task was 
                     created ("Starting after ... and before ...") and by due date ("Due after ... and before ...").
                     Only the tasks starting and/or due between those dates will be shown in your search.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Priority</strong>
                     <p>This allows you to search for tasks of a certain priority or priorities.  Only
                     tasks with the priority you specify will show in your new list.</p>
                </li>
        </ul>
</p>
