<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'Task Review' &>

Task review is a little something we cooked up to make it easier to look at everything
you've put in Hiveminder.  By doing all the legwork of stepping you through your tasks, 
we hope to strip as much monotony and pain from addressing your to do lists as possible.
Once you agree to strap yourself in for a review, you have the following choices:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Take Action</strong> 
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Do this today</strong>
         <br/>
         This will set a "hide until" date for today, ensuring that the task will
         show up on any current search, starting today.  It will also save any changes
         you make to the owner, the tags, or any other data on the screen.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Done!</strong>
         <br/>
         You're done!  Enjoy the brain-applied seratonin hit as you click this.
         It's the equivalent of clicking the checkbox in your To Do list.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Next</strong>
         <br/>
         If you've changed any details (owner, tags, etc.) on the task, clicking 
         "Next" will save the changes you've made and take you to the next task.
         </li>
     </ul>
  </li>   
  <li><strong>Ignore until...</strong>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Tomorrow</strong>
         <br/>
          Hides your task until tomorrow.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Saturday</strong>
         <br/>
          Hides your task until the next Saturday in the calendar.  If it is Saturday
          when you click this, it moves to the next Saturday in the calendar.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Monday</strong>
         <br/>
          Hides your task until the next Monday in the calendar.  If it is Monday
          when you click this, it moves to the next Monday in the calendar.
         </li>
         <li><strong>next month</strong>
         <br/>
          Hides your task until the same numeric date in the following month.  For 
          example, if you are reviewing on the 23rd of June, your task will hide
          until the 23rd of July.
         </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Other...</strong>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>Delete</strong>
         <br/>
          Removes the task forever.  There's no getting it back!  It
          does first ask you if you're sure, though.
         </li>
         <li><strong>Stop review</strong>
         <br/>
          Brings the task review to a screeching halt, and pops you
          back to where you were when you started it.
         </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
