    <p><b>We take your privacy and security very seriously.  When you
    choose to use Hiveminder to keep track of what needs doing, you're
    entrusting us with something important to you.  We're going to do
    everything we can to make sure that your information stays safe
    and private.  The legalese below basically says that we can charge
    you for your Pro account if you buy one, that we do actually
    collect your personal information, that we'll be very careful with
    it and that if somebody tries to mess with us or you, we can do
    what we need to to stop them and make sure it doesn't happen
    again.</b></p>

    <p><b>Our lawyers are somewhat old-school and believe strongly in the
    power of dense legalese to protect everybody involved. If anything
    on this page makes your spidey-sense tingle, drop us a line at <a
        href="mailto:info@hiveminder.com">info@hiveminder.com</a> and
    we'll do whatever we can to improve the situation.</b></p>
