<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'Feeds/Synchronizing' &>

<p>You can receive an atom feed of your tasks by clicking the feed icon <img src="/static/images/silk/feed.png" />.  
Right now, Hiveminder only supports one-way syncing with your iCalendar applications like Apple's iCal
or Google Calendar <img src="/static/images/ical.new.png" />, but we've got a couple aces up 
our sleeve and should be able to support round-trip iCalendar syncing in the near future. We do provide full round-trip to text 
files for all you lifehackers - just click on the page icon <img src="/static/images/silk/page_white_text.png" />.
If you're a little more old-school and would rather have a paper list to work from during the day, click the 
printer icon <img src="/static/images/silk/printer.png" />. Your printed list will include a URL so you can get back 
to that same list later on and check stuff off for good.</p>

<p>Your iCalendar and Atom feeds work something like a saved list.  If you search for a list by a tag, 
then all future tasks with that tag will be sent to the feed you generate from that list.
It is important to keep the feed URLs private though, because otherwise people can see your tasks.
If you run into that situation however, we have given you an out.  You can go to the Preferences 
page via the top navigation bar and then onto the "Feed URLs" tab.  By pushing that button you can
destroy all of your feeds.  You'll have to re-create your feeds, but all of your compromised 
feeds will go away.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with textfile maintenance and want to give it a try, here's how:
<ol>
<li>Click the <img src="/static/images/silk/page_white_text.png" /> icon.  This will allow you 
to download whatever list you are currently viewing.  Make sure to save it someplace you can 
easily find it, like the desktop.</li>
<li>Edit your tasks.  You can add tasks, delete tasks, modify them etc.  Make sure you don't 
mess up the code at the bottom though, or you will not be able to upload textfile again.  If
that happens, download the textfile again and make you changes again.</li>
<li>To upload, point your web browser at http://hiveminder.com/upload.  Hiveminder will
open an Upload window. Browse to your edited file, and select it.</li>
<li>Click 'Update It!'</li>
</ol>
