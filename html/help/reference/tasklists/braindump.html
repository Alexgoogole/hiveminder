<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'Braindump' &>

We realize that no "to do" list springs fully-formed from your head, like Athena from Zeus'.
We provide the opportunity to spit the things you have to do into Hiveminder quickly and painlessly on pretty much every page.  
These "braindump" boxes allow you to quickly
type out tasks as they occur to you so that you don't forget them, and the tasks are then added to your 
To Do List.  You can always add information to or organize them later, but at least they're out 
of your head.  

<h2>Braindump Syntax</h2>
<p>Type a task name on a line; one task per line.  Create as many tasks as you 
like by using multiple lines.  If the task name contains square brackets <code>[ ]</code> with one or more words inside
separated by spaces (eg. '<code>[stuff things]</code>'), those words become its 
tags.  This does not become part of the final task name.
</p>
<p>Any line under the task name which begins with a space becomes part of the task
description.  If the task name or description contains
a date, that becomes the task's due date.  These do become part of the task's details.
</p>
<p>You can give your task a priority by including 'plus' and 'minus' signs
at the start of the task title.  See below for the key:

<ul><li><code>++</code> &#8594; highest</li>
<li><code>+</code> &#8594; high</li>
<li>nothing &#8594; normal</li>
<li><code>-</code> &#8594; low</li>
<li><code>--</code> &#8594; lowest</li></ul>

These priority markings do not become part of the final task 
name.</p>

<p>If you include exclamation points in the task's title, you can also increase its priority
according to the scheme below:
<ul><li><code>!!</code> &#8594; highest</li>
<li><code>!</code> &#8594; high</li></ul>

These priority markings do become part of the final task 
name.</p>

% if ( Jifty->web->current_user->has_group_with_feature('Projects') ) {
<p>To create a project or milestone in a braindump, prefix the name with "Project:" or "Milestone:", like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Project: Hiveminder [group: Best Practical]</code> &#8594; creates a new project called "Hiveminder" in the group "Best Practical"</li>
  <li><code>Milestone: Project management [group: Best Practical]</code> &#8594; creates a new milestone called "Project management" in the group "Best Practical"</li>
</ul>

<p>These "Project:" and "Milestone:" prefixes, as seen in the example, do <em>not</em> become part of the final project or milestone name.</p>
% }

<p>In addition to tags, square brackets <code>[ ]</code> can be used to add extra information to your
task (eg. '<code>[due: friday]</code>').  See below for a list.

<ul>
 <li><code>[due: thursday]</code> &#8594; set 'Date due' to Thursday's date</li>
 <li>Set Owner</li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>[owner: steve@example.com]</code> &#8594; Assign this task to
	 <code>steve@example.com</code></li>
  <li><code>[by: steve@example.com]</code> &#8594; Assign this task to 
	 <code>steve@example.com</code></li>
 </ul>
 <li>Set Group</li>
 <ul>
   <li><code>[group: mygroup]</code> &#8594; Put this task in the '<code>mygroup</code>' group</li>

  <li><code>[priority: low]</code> &#8594; this is a low-priority task</li>
  <li><code>[prio: low]</code> &#8594; this is a low-priority task</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Set 'Hide until'</li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>[hide until: friday]</code> &#8594;  set 'Hide until' to Friday's date</li>
  <li><code>[hide: friday]</code> &#8594; set 'Hide until' to Friday's date</li>
  <li><code>[starts: friday]</code> &#8594; set 'Hide until' to Friday's date</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Set 'Will not complete'</li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>[hide: forever]</code> &#8594; set 'Will not complete'</li>
  <li><code>[starts: never]</code> &#8594; set 'Will not complete'</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Set Repetition</li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>[every: week]</code> &#8594;  repeat every week</li>
  <li><code>[repeats monthly]</code> &#8594; repeat every month</li>
 </ul>
% if (Jifty->config->app('FeatureFlags')->{TimeTracking}) {
 <li>Time Tracking</li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>[time: 2h]</code> &#8594;  set 'Time left' to 2 hours</li>

  <li><code>[then: #ADE]</code> &#8594; task #ADE depends on this</li>
 </ul>

 <ul>
  <li><code>[complete: 1]</code> &#8594; automatically mark the task as complete</li>

% if ( Jifty->web->current_user->has_group_with_feature('Projects') ) {
 <li>Project management</li>
 <ul>
  <li><code>[project: Hiveminder]</code> &#8594; set the task's project to the "Hiveminder" project</li>
  <li><code>[milestone: Project management]</code> &#8594; set the task's milestone to the "Project management" milestone</li>
 </ul>
% }
</ul>

This extra information does not become part of the final task name</p>

<p>You can also create new <a href="/help/how-to/dependencies-(and-then...-but-first...).html">dependent tasks</a> in braindump. Indent the next line, include "but first:" or "and then:" then type the new task summary. You can even specify dependencies for your dependencies, and dependencies for those, ad nauseam (just be sure to have a task you can complete!)</p>

<p>Braindumping to groups can be done from the tasklist braindump if you are currently in the list
for that group.  You can always change the group within a braindump by using the <code>[group: groupname]</code>
syntax.</p>
