<p>Sending yourself a task by email is useful when you have access to email but not
Hiveminder, such as when using a Blackberry or SMS.  Other people can use this address to send you 
tasks by email as well.  You can create different emails and use them to manage who is sending 
you tasks by email.  Creating a task by email is easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/prefs/addresses',
                                 label  => 'Tasks by email',
                                 class  => 'external' ) %>
      under <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/prefs',
                                 label  => 'Preferences',
                                 class  => 'external' ) %>.
  </li>
  <li>If no addresses are listed, click the "Add a new address" button.</li>  
  <li>You can open an email by clicking on the linked address, or you can copy and paste
  the address into the "to" field of your preferred mail client.</li>

  <li>Type the task summary as the subject of the new email and the
  task description as the body of the message.</li>

  <li>Additionally, you can assign a default set of
  <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/help/reference/tasklists/braindump.html',
                       label  => 'braindump tags' ) %>
  which all tasks created via the address will have applied to them,
  and whether tasks sent to the email address will automatically be
  accepted.</li>
</ol>

<p>"Incoming address" under the "Manage" tab in a group you are the
organizer for will also allow you to create an address for emailing
tasks to your group.  If you are a Member or a Guest but think that
this is something your group could use, notify one of the
Organizers of the group.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="/pro" class="external">pro users</a> can assign tasks by
email to anyone with an email address.  By sending email to
"<b>bob@example.com</b>.<i>secret</i>.with.hm", you will assign a task
to <b>bob@example.com</b>.  In order to ensure that other people can't
forge emails from you, and create tasks as you, you'll need to <a
href="/prefs/addresses">set a secret</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/prefs/addresses',
                                 label  => 'Tasks by email',
                                 class  => 'external' ) %>
      under <% Jifty->web->link( url    => '/prefs',
                                 label  => 'Preferences',
                                 class  => 'external' ) %>.
  </li>

  <li>Fill in your secret in the box labelled "Email secret".  We find
  that adverbs roll off the tongue particularly well for a secret --
  for example, "merrily" would let you send email to
  "bob@example.com.merrily.with.hm".</li>

  <li>You can now use your mail client to write emails to
  "<i>any-email-address</i>.<i>secret</i>.with.hm" -- even your own
  email address.</li>

  <li>Type the task summary as the subject of the new email and the
  task description as the body of the message.</li>

</ol>
