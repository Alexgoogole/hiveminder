<&| /help/_elements/wrapper, title => 'Default sort' &>

The "Default" sort will order your tasks like so:
<ol>
<li>By whether or not they're complete</li>
<li>By due date</li>
<li>By priority</li>
<li>in order of creation. </li>
</ol>
It will only show 
the tasks you're searching for, however.  For instance, it will not show your "done"
tasks unless you have checked the box in "Search" to show "Done" tasks.
