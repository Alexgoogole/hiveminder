%# terse: create NEWTASK. Create new tasks! You don't actually need to use this, I interpret most things as task creation. http://tinyurl.com/yo8kt9

<p>The command to create new tasks. Works identically to the braindump box on every Hiveminder page.</p>

<p>For rapid-fire task creation you can type in just <b>create</b> with no task and you'll enter <i>modal create</i> mode. Every subsequent message is collected and made into one big braindump at the end. You finish the create by sending <b>done</b> on its own line. You can also cancel the create with <b>cancel</b> on its own line.</p>

<p>You can also use <b>create [tags] [due: tomorrow]</b> and so on to apply the tags and other attributes to all tasks created during the modal create.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>create make dinner tonight [grocery]</li>
    <li>c eat dinner tonight [food]</li>
    <li>modal create:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>create [food dinner] [due tonight]</li>
        <li>buy dinner [grocery money]</li>
        <li>eat dinner</li>
        <li>do dishes [chore]</li>
        <li>done</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
